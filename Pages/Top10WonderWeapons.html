      Servant, offering high damage, crowd control, and often unpredictable,

      <p>
        The R.A.I. K-84 is a hybrid assault rifle and energy weapon that fires
        both rapid shots and a charged explosive blast. Its alternate firing
        mode slows zombies, making it highly effective for crowd control. The
        combination of standard rifle mechanics with a Wonder Weapon’s power
        makes it very player-friendly, as it offers both familiarity and a
        unique edge for high rounds.

        bolts that deal splash damage. It’s easy to use, deals good damage,
        and has a high ammo capacity. Though its splash damage can hurt the
        user, its straightforward functionality makes it an ideal weapon for
        beginners looking to survive longer rounds.
